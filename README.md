# Blocky
Replaces specific texture pack items/blocks and replaces them as independent blocks under Blocky. Currently only contains basic code, development has been paused for the time being. Development will resume once java syntaxes are refamiliarized. 

## Stuff that will be added:
-  Replacement of texture packs by creating new, independent blocks instead
  - The texture packs are added to the mod's directory, NOT the game's directory;
    - The Mod detects the models and converts it to blocks and items.
