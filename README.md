# Blocky
Replaces specific texture pack items/blocks and replaces them as independent blocks under Blocky. Currently only contains basic code, development has been paused for the time being. Development will resume once java syntaxes are refamiliarized. 

## Stuff that will be added:
- Full Removal of texture pack (replace texture pack blocks as completely independent blocks)
- Add texture pack to a location in Mincraft directory
  - Mod detects models and converts it into a block/item
